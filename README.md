# Code-Refactor

## Brief Description
  Going through the coding and trying to refactor the website. I came to the realization there were to many "Div Classes" being used.
  So what I ended up doing is shortening the amount of "Divs" being used. Then tried to the best of my ability to replace them with semantic HTML tags.
  While at the same time changing these tags in the CSS. So they would comply with eachother. Also made a couple fixes That werent working on the website.

## HTML
  For the First screenshot you will see that I gave the website a proper title. Along with fixing a link that was missing and getting rid
  of some "Div Classes".

For the next screenshot I repeated the same process of eliminating more "Div Classes". While keeping some and changing them to one category 
to put them under one section on the CSS.
